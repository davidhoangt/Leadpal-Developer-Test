# Developer Test
Leadpals developer test for prospective developer candidates.

### Overview

Our Developer Test is a simple test we give prospective developer candidates to see how they perform with a given coding assignment.

Your task: Create a PHP script that performs two API calls to OpenWeather API to get weather data for Brisbane, one to get the current weather, and the other to get a 3 day weather forecast.

The script should output a HTML page that displays the following: 

A section that displays the current weather data including:
* General weather description 
* Temperature
* Temperature feels like
* Temp min
* Temp max
* Sunrise and Sunset times
* Humidity

A section with a 3 day weather forecast with the first day starting TOMORROW, each day should display the following data for both 9am (morning) and 3pm (afternoon):
* General weather description 
* Temperature
* Humidity

Notes:
* The website should display values in METRIC.
* The PHP can either be above the HTML or inline, but all code should be easy to read, well commented, and properly formatted.
* The website layout should be clean and styled.
* Your CSS can be either internal or external.
* Your HTML and CSS should pass W3 validation.
* Make it your own. Feel free to display the data with assets/icon or however you like.
